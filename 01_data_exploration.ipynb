Step 5: Create Initial Notebook
Create notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb:

python
# Cell 1: Imports and Setup
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Set style
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
sns.set_palette("husl")

print("✅ Libraries imported successfully!")

# Cell 2: Load Data
# Load the datasets
train = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/train.csv', parse_dates=['Date'])
store = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/store.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('../data/raw/test.csv', parse_dates=['Date'])

# Merge train with store info
df = train.merge(store, on='Store', how='left')

print(f"Train shape: {train.shape}")
print(f"Store shape: {store.shape}")
print(f"Test shape: {test.shape}")
print(f"Merged shape: {df.shape}")

# Cell 3: Basic EDA
# Display first few rows
display(df.head())

# Check data types
display(df.dtypes)

# Check for missing values
display(df.isnull().sum())

# Basic statistics
display(df.describe())

# Cell 4: More analysis cells...
# Add your analysis here
Step 6: Add and Commit Your Files
bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Initial project setup with folder structure and documentation"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
Step 7: Add Additional Documentation
Create reports/final_report.md:

markdown
# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction - Final Report

## Executive Summary

[Add your executive summary here]

## 1. Business Problem

## 2. Data Description

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 4. Feature Engineering

## 5. Model Development

## 6. Results

## 7. Business Impact

## 8. Conclusions and Recommendations
Step 8: Create a Project Board (Optional)
Go to your GitHub repository
Click "Projects" tab
Click "New project"
Choose "Board" template
Add columns:
📋 To Do
🔄 In Progress
✅ Done
Add cards for tasks:
Download dataset
Data exploration
Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Model training
Model evaluation
Documentation
etc.
Step 9: Regular Commits
As you work, commit regularly:

bash
# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Data exploration notebook with initial visualizations"
git push origin main

# More descriptive commit messages:
# "Add: Feature engineering for time-based features"
# "Fix: Handle missing values in CompetitionDistance"
# "Update: README with results and insights"
# "Add: XGBoost model implementation"
Step 10: Add Badges and Polish
Add these to your README for professional look:

🎨 Pro Tips
Commit Often: Make small, frequent commits with clear messages
Write Tests: Add unit tests for your functions (optional but impressive)
Document Everything: Add docstrings to functions
Use Branches: Create feature branches for major changes
Add Visualizations: Include plots in README
Update Progress: Keep README updated with your progress
Link to Notebook: Add nbviewer links to your notebooks
Add Screenshots: Include visualization screenshots
🚀 Next Steps
Download the Rossmann dataset from Kaggle
Start with 01_data_exploration.ipynb
Commit your progress after each major milestone
Update README with findings and results
Add visualizations to reports/figures/
Would you like me to:

Help you write the first notebook (data exploration)?
Create starter code for the Python scripts?
Show you how to add interactive visualizations?
Help with specific parts of the project?
Let me know and I'll assist you further! 🚀

I have created the repo. Now I want to populate it with 3 files for data analysis.


Crafted three strategic notebooks for comprehensive data analysis.




Perfect! Let me help you create 3 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks for data analysis. These will be production-ready files that you can directly add to your repository.

📊 The 3 Files We'll Create
01_data_exploration.ipynb - Initial data exploration and understanding
02_data_cleaning.ipynb - Data cleaning and preprocessing
03_feature_engineering.ipynb - Creating new features for modeling
File 1: 01_data_exploration.ipynb
01_data_exploration.ipynb

File 2: 02_data_cleaning.ipynb
02_data_cleaning.ipynb
